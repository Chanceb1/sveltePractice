## Developing

Once you've created a project, install dependencies using npm or bun:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using bun
bun install
```

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

# Using bun
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with:
